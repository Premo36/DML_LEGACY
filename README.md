# DML 1.1 Source Code (Legacy)
This is the old VB.NET Doom Mod Loader 1.1 source code. Comprehensive of the whole Visual Studio solution.<br>
Version 1.1 it's not a "real" update, just a little polishing before release the source code on github.

# Changelog - 23/06/2019 | 1.0 > 1.1

  <li>Fixed bug where mod presets will not load the first mod in the list.</li>
  <li>Expanded iwad and pwad capacity, now you can load up to 100 iwad and 1000 pwad.</li>
  <li>Updated the about box with the new mail (p36software[at]mail.com).</li>
  <li>Renamed all functions and varibiles in English.</li>
</ul>

# License
You can use the DML 1.1 source code in any way you like as long as you respect the <a href="https://github.com/Premo36/DML_Legacy/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License</a>.

# WARNING
I wrote DML back in 2016 when I was still in school, learning the basics of programming.<br>
Even if with the 1.1 update I fixed a few things I stumble upon while renaming some stuff, I didn't bother to fix/clean the whole code, as I've been working on... 

# DML 2.X 
... a complete remake from scratch in C# that you can find on modDB!
